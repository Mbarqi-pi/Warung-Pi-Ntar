# Merchant Partnership Model and Fiat-Based Deposit Strategy

## 1. Concept Overview
Warung Pi Ntar acts as a **facilitator, guarantor, and educator** in the process of Pi adoption among local merchants.  
Understanding that most merchants still have limited knowledge of Pi Network and are not ready to take on digital transaction risks, Warung Pi Ntar takes an active role through a **fiat-based deposit scheme**.

The primary purpose of this system is to **build trust and ensure that collaboration is risk-free** for merchants while introducing real Pi transactions within the community.

## 2. Mechanism of Collaboration

### a. Initial Deposit (Fiat by Warung Pi Ntar)
Warung Pi Ntar provides each partner merchant with a **fiat deposit** (conventional money) whose value is determined by agreement.  
This deposit represents an initial trust-building measure — merchants gain confidence that the partnership is safe and supported financially.

### b. Hybrid Transaction System
- Merchants continue serving customers as usual using fiat payments.  
- For customers from the Pi community who wish to pay using Pi, the merchant accepts the transaction.  
- The **Pi received from customers** is then **sent back to Warung Pi Ntar** into a dedicated *merchant wallet*.  
- In essence, the merchant only experiences a **conversion process from fiat to Pi** without financial loss or uncertainty.

### c. Merchant Data Integration
All participating merchants are:
- **Registered and mapped** on the official Pi Map.  
- Included in Warung Pi Ntar’s **public campaign and publication strategy**.  
This visibility functions as **free and permanent promotion**, showcasing each merchant’s involvement in Pi adoption.

## 3. Education and Campaign Strategy
Beyond transaction facilitation, Warung Pi Ntar also provides:
- **Training and assistance** to improve merchant understanding of Pi wallets, security, and digital economy concepts.  
- **Practical learning via the top-up scheme**, allowing merchants to gain hands-on experience safely.  
- **Publicity and branding**, positioning every merchant as a real-world example of Pi usability.

## 4. Long-Term Objective
The ultimate goal is to prepare each merchant to **become an independent Warung Pi Ntar**,  
capable of accepting and using Pi directly without relying on deposit systems.

Through this phased and trust-based approach, Warung Pi Ntar gradually builds a **sustainable Pi economy network**, grounded in real economic activity and community education.
